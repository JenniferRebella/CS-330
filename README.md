To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure I follow coding best practices and run tests as I am working to reduce complication while merging code together.

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by breaking down of the requirements given by the customer by what it must and must not do.

I approach designing software carefully since having a good design for the software will save time and reduce errors.
